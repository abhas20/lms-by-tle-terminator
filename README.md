## 🎯 Key Features

### 👩‍🏫 Course & Lecture Management

* Create and manage courses and curriculum
* Upload video lectures, audio, and PDF notes
* Support for free and paid lectures

### 🎥 Live Lecture System

* Real‑time live class support
* Low‑latency interaction design
* Extensible to integrate video conferencing tools

### 👀 Attention Engine

* Computer vision–based microservice for analyzing student attentiveness during live lectures  
* Processes image frames via API in real time  
* Computes:
  * Face presence confidence  
  * Head pose confidence  
  * Gaze direction confidence  
* Aggregates signals into an overall attention score per student  
* Integrates seamlessly with live lecture sessions  
* Helps instructors monitor engagement and identify attention drops  
* Designed as an independent, scalable microservice that can be enabled per course

### 📝 Quizzes & Assessments

* Create quizzes per course or lecture
* Track student attempts and scores
* Scalable for objective evaluation

### 💬 Course Community Chat

* Course‑specific discussion channels
* Real‑time messaging via WebSockets
* Upvote‑based message relevance and moderation

### 🤖 AI Course Tutor

* Course‑aware AI assistant that answers doubts using lecture context
* Embedding‑based retrieval from course materials
* Independent chat history per student
* Pluggable to local LLMs or API models

### 🧠 AI Summary Generator 

The **AI Summary Generator** automatically creates **concise, structured summaries per lecture** by processing the **audio of the lecture**.

- 🎧 Converts lecture audio → text  
- 🧠 Generates an AI-based summary for that specific lecture  
- 📌 Stores summaries lecture-wise for quick revision  

This enables students to revise faster and allows teachers to provide instant, high-quality recap material with zero manual effort.


### 📏 Stem Learning Module

* Dedicated STEM learning section with interactive quizes and experiments
* Ask any doubt feature powered by AI
* Separate frontend and backend services for modularity

This module is designed to enhance STEM education by providing interactive content and AI assistance specifically tailored for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects.

## ⚙️ Installation (Local Setup)

> Tested locally for development. Adjust ports and environment variables for production deployments.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prasoon52/lms-by-tle-terminator.git
cd lms-by-tle-terminator
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```

> backend will typically runs on port `8000` depending on configuration.

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```

> LMS frontend dev server typically runs on `localhost:5173` and STEM frontend on `localhost:3000`.

### 4. Attention Engine (Optional setup for focusing monitoring)

```bash
cd Attention_Engine
python3 -m venv venv # On Windows use `python -m venv venv`
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

cd ../attention_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

> Attention Engine runs as a separate microservice (Flask). Configure frontend/backend to call the attention API endpoint when enabled.

### 5. Stem Learning Module
- Backend Setup

```bash
cd ../stem-backend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```
> STEM backend will typically runs on port `5001` depending on configuration.

- Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../stem-frontend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```

> STEM frontend dev server typically runs on `localhost:3000`.
